       <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>
          My coding journey began at PowerLearn Academy, where I immersed myself in the world of programming and honed my skills.
          At PowerLearn Academy, I underwent an intensive and comprehensive learning experience. Through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, I gained a solid foundation in various programming languages, front-end and back-end development, and responsive design principles. The challenging curriculum pushed me to think critically and creatively, equipping me with the tools needed to tackle real-world coding challenges.
          Putting in countless hours of hard work and dedication, I embraced the opportunity to deepen my understanding of coding concepts and develop a problem-solving mindset. The dynamic and collaborative learning environment at PowerLearn Academy fueled my passion for creating innovative and user-centric web solutions.
